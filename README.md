# Hidden Markov Model
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modelled is assumed to be a Markov process Z with unobservable "hidden" states. HMM assumes that there is another process X whose behaviour "depends" on Z. The goal is to learn about Z by observing X.
